"""
This the sarcastic chatbot (with minor tweaks) named Marv 
The original example code is provided by OpenAI at https://beta.openai.com/examples/default-marv-sarcastic-chat
I have excluded a few config parameters that I prefer to change globally in the main .py file
Those parameters are: model, max_tokens, stop
You may change any of the constants to your liking.
